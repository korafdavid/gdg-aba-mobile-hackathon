const WEB = '''
Introduction \n
In this course, you'll learn all about becoming a web developer, from the responsibilities that a web developer performs on a day-to-day basis to the set of skills that you’d need to succeed in such a role. And, of course, you’ll also get your hands dirty with code: We’ll introduce you to the fundamental building blocks of the web and make sure you leave this course having developed your very first website!

 Who is a web developer? \n
A web developer is at heart an interactive artist. They’re someone driven by a deep desire to create things. A web developer’s canvas is a user’s web browser.

Much like how a curious child takes pleasure in making toys by joining LEGO blocks—and then experiences a similar joy in taking things apart to see how they’re made, a web developer’s job is to use the basic building blocks of the web (like HTML, CSS and JavaScript) to create something complex like a webpage. Don’t sweat it! We’ll get into all of those terms soon.

It is also the web developer’s job to diagnose problems in a website’s functionality, to understand how something works by reading the code behind it, and to make changes to fix any issues. That essentially makes web developers the physicians of the world wide web. When we talk about the world wide web, we’re mainly referring to websites and web applications. At this point, the curious aspiring developer in you might be wondering, “What’s the difference between the two?”

Well, we’re glad you asked! A website is usually a simple page or a group of pages (the popular web comic site, xkcd, for example). However, modern websites are much more than that. Take Google Docs, for example. It has a nice interface that, once opened, looks very much like a desktop software like Microsoft Office. Such complex websites are often termed web applications. A web developer today is expected to know how to create and work with web applications. Having said that, most people use the terms interchangeably, so don't get too hung up on the terminology!


 What are the skills required to become a web developer? \n
What does it take to become a web developer? Essentially, just three things: HTML, CSS and JavaScript—the three pillars of the web, which we’ll be learning about over the next few days. Together, these three pillars make every website work, defining the content to be displayed (HTML), telling a browser how to display that content (CSS), and making the content interactive (JavaScript), respectively.

A web developer is well versed in these three technologies. They can read other people’s code and make changes to it. They can find and debug bugs (shortcomings in existing code). A web developer might, at times, work on a new project (a new website) from scratch, or may have to work on an existing website and make it better. A typical day in the life of a web developer involves fixing bugs, developing new features (that is, enhancements) and webpages, and working with other developers to discuss ways to solve problems.

Don’t be overwhelmed by all of these details. You’ll soon see that they’re all very connected, and learning one of these automatically makes you good at a few others!

const appdevelopment =  '''
What is mobile application development?\n
Mobile application development is the process to making software for smartphones and digital assistants, most commonly for Android and iOS. The software can be preinstalled on the device, downloaded from a mobile app store or accessed through a mobile web browser. The programming and markup languages used for this kind of software development include Java, Swift, C# and HTML5.

Mobile app development is rapidly growing. From retail, telecommunications and e-commerce to insurance, healthcare and government, organizations across industries must meet user expectations for real-time, convenient ways to conduct transactions and access information. Today, mobile devices—and the mobile applications that unlock their value—are the most popular way for people and businesses to connect to the internet. To stay relevant, responsive and successful, organizations need to develop the mobile applications that their customers, partners and employees demand.

Yet mobile application development might seem daunting. Once you’ve selected the OS platform or platforms, you need to overcome the limitations of mobile devices and usher your app all the way past the potential hurdles of distribution. Fortunately, by following a few basic guidelines and best practices, you can streamline your application development journey.

Choose a platform\n
Many independent application development teams choose to build their apps for Android first. Why? The vast majority—around 70 percent—of smartphones run Android, and the Google Play Store has fewer restrictions than the Apple App Store. On the other hand, mobile applications developed for iOS have far fewer devices that need support, making optimization simpler. And user retention is typically higher for iOS applications.

Depending on the intended use case and target audience for the mobile application you are developing, you might have other considerations. For example, if you’re designing an app for your organization’s employees, you’ll need to support the platforms they use, which may mean developing cross-platform apps that work for both Android and iOS. Or if you’re building a mobile application for your customers and you know the majority of them use iPhones, then developing iOS applications should be a top priority. Additional considerations when developing your mobile applications include monetization strategies and anticipated user behavior, which can be influenced by geographical and cultural factors.

Develop for both Android and iOS: Native apps or hybrid apps?\n
Let’s say you need to do mobile application development for both the Android operating system and iOS. What is the best software development approach?

You could develop two native applications. Taking advantage of native APIs and OS-specific programming languages can help you build a powerful app. Most enterprise apps, especially ones that require substantial API traffic, benefit from native development.

If you decide to develop native applications one at a time, you’ll likely want to begin with Android—for some of the same reasons that independent app developers often focus on Android. You’ll probably have better luck developing the full application as an MVP on Android and then converting and optimizing it to iOS after release.

You will still need to debug and rewrite the code for the native language and redesign the front-end user interface, because the two operating systems function very differently, making cross-platform operation impossible.

Another option is to go hybrid, taking a write-once-run-anywhere approach. Hybrid apps use a single codebase that can function on either platform. They’re typically coded in a programming language that’s universally recognized, such as Java, JavaScript, HTML or CSS. Because you’re denied access to the operating system’s native APIs, hybrid mobile application development works best for simple web applications—three- or four-page mobile applications with limited functionality.

const gamedevelopment =  '''
  What is Game Development?\n
Simply speaking, Game Development is the overall process of creating a video game. And if you thought that making a video game is as easy as playing one, well it’s not!!! There are many components while creating a game such as Story, Characters, Audio, Art, Lighting, etc. that eventually merge together to create a whole new world in a video game!!! This process of Game Development for commercial games is funded by a publisher (a rich company!) but independent video games are comparatively cheaper and smaller so they can be funded by individuals also (That can be you!).

Now there is a common doubt relating to Game Development that only good Game Players can be good Game Developers. So let’s address that now.

Is Being a Good Game Player necessary for Game Development?\n
There are many people who assume that if they are good Game Players then they will definitely be good in Game Development. Well, don’t make that mistake!!! If you are a good Game Player then you have some advantage because you already know something about game stories, players, levels etc. But that’s it! Actually Game Playing and Game Development are very different fields and the skills you acquire in the former will not necessarily help you in the latter. For example: If you love movies, that doesn’t necessarily mean you will be a good movie director!!! So get into Game Development only if you are passionate about game programming and really want to develop a game for fun(Loving game playing is just a bonus!).

What are the Different Components in Game Development?\n
There are many different components in Game Development that can either be handled by a single developer who is individually creating a game (and who is a genius!!!) or normally by a team of multiple people. So if you want to get started with Game Development, it’s best to first understand the various components in this field so that you can identify the ones that most interest you.

1. Story: Everything has a story and that is equally true for video games!!! Your story can have a linear structure which is relatively easy, or it can even have a non-linear structure with various plot changes according to character actions. The main point is that there should be an interesting story to hook your players!!!

2. Characters: Do you know any story without characters? No! That’s because, after the story, the characters are a fundamental part of any video game. You have to decide the looks and personalities of the characters, how fast they should move, what should be manners and characteristics etc.

3. Audio: It is the backbone of video games!!! That means it should support the game and yet not be too obvious! You have to decide the various sounds in the game world like player sounds, background music, etc. that together create a lifelike and believable video game.

4. Art: It can be said that video games are basically just responsive art!!! So art is very important as it decides the feel of the game. Normally art in video games can include various things like the game texture, game lighting, 3D modeling of characters and objects, particle systems to create fire, fog, snow, etc.

5. Lighting: All the lighting in video games is obviously artificial and very important for mood setting. Less lighting can be used in association with horror or thriller games while increased lighting can denote more adventure or fun games. Also, lighting can be an important factor in stealth challenges with darker areas providing cover to characters.

6. Levels: All good video games have various levels that increase the difficulty as time goes on. Levels can be denoted in games by multiple floors, different buildings, or even different countries (Depending on the game you are playing!) and each level can have many potential paths that eventually lead to the next level. And designing games with many possible path combinations for different levels is a big factor in Game Development.

How to Start Learning Game Development?\n
Now that you have understood all the components involved in Game Development, the topics provided here are a roadmap that is enough to make you understand the basics of Learning Game Development. After learning these you can make a decent game and then move on to creating more and more complex worlds as you progress.

1. Learn Computer Programming: The interesting world-view in a game is all created using Computer programming. So it stands to reason that you need to know programming in case you want to enter this world! Now if you have some basic knowledge about coding in programming languages like C++, C#, Python, Java, etc. then great, otherwise it’s best if you learn programming before moving any further.

There is no specific programming language that is exclusively used for Game Development. But C++ is the most popular in game development and also the most commonly used language for writing game engines. Some of the popular games made with C++ are Counter-Strike, King Quest, World of Warcraft, etc. Another popular language is Java as it has multithreading and sockets. A popular game made in Java is Angry Birds Chrome.

Note: If you are a total beginner, you can refer Introduction to Computer Science by Harvard University to get a basic understanding of Computer programming.

2. Choose a known Game Engine: As you are a beginner in Game Development, it is best to start with a known Game Engine. They are quite useful in general as they provide various functionalities for your games like 3D and 2D graphics rendering, audio support, animation, collision detection, artificial intelligence, networking, etc.

The most popular Game Engine is Unity as it is quite easy to learn, and also has the personal edition which is free! Another popular Game Engine is the Unreal Engine which can be modified to create unique games. However, eventually it doesn’t matter what Game Engine you use but what matters is that you stick with that game engine so that you understand it well enough to use it in future projects.
On a side point, it is not absolutely essential that you use a Game Engine. In fact, not using a Game Engine will mean you have to do most of the technical work yourself, which is hard but will provide you many learning opportunities. It will even be useful in case you have to develop the design patterns for game programming yourself some time in the future!

3. Create a Basic Game: Now that you have some idea of Game Development, create a basic game. Now you might want to get carried away and wish to create a masterpiece but trust me and start small!! Try to keep your project around a week or so because the most important thing now is not that you become a master overnight but that you understand the basics.

A common first game is Tetris as it is easy to make and yet it will introduce you to many concepts in Game Development. It will basically teach you about the three steps in the Game Loop i.e. initialize, update and draw which are at the heart of any possible game development you will do in the future.

But in case you are not interested in starting with Tetris, you can pick any game that is easy enough (or difficult, it’s your choice!!!) but make sure that the game is not confusing or complicated and it has a clear objective and endpoint.

4. Understand Game Design Patterns: Game Design Patterns is where things get a little complicated as you have already understood the basics of making a video game. But the first question is, What are Game Design Patterns?

Suppose that you have to put in multiple asteroids that destroy a spaceship in a space video game. It is much wiser in this situation to have a code module that can be reused again and again for the asteroids rather than focusing on individual asteroids. This is a Game Design Pattern known as Object pooling. Similarly, there are many Game Design Patterns that are basically just templates for creating modular code that can be used as a repeated solution for any problem in Game Development.

Some of the other common Game Design Patterns are Flyweight, Prototype, Observer, etc. It’s best that you first understand these Game Patterns and then apply them in various small games. This will help you in understanding the various impacts and benefits that Game Design Patterns can have on Game Development in general.

Note: A fantastic book for learning Game Design Patterns is Game Programming Patterns by Robert Nystrom that will elaborate on various Design Patterns to optimize your game.

5. Learn 3D Graphics and Associated Maths: It is not possible to make a video game without graphics and so you need to learn about them now. And while 2D graphics were quite popular in the mid-1990s, most of the famous games today require 3D graphics which can be rendered in Fixed 3D, First-person perspective, Third-person perspective, etc. which provides a realistic feeling to the game. So if you want to become a top-notch Game Programmer, you should know computer graphics and also the mathematics behind it. This is even more important if you are not planning on using an already-made game engine.

The maths commonly required for 3D Graphics is Linear Algebra which mainly deals with linear equations, matrices, vectors, etc. If you understand these concepts, you can easily manipulate the 3D world of your game to achieve miraculous effects!!!

Note: You can learn 3D Graphics in Game Development using 3D Math Primer for Graphics and Game Development Book and the Basic Linear Algebra from the MIT OpenCourseWare Linear Algebra course available on YouTube.

const backend = '''
  What is Backend Development\n
Backend Development is the term for the behind-the-scenes activities that happens when you do anything on a website or web application. It is mostly referred to the server-side of an application and everything that communicates between the database and the frontend/browser.

You can also say that it’s the server side of development that focuses primarily on how the site works.

Who is a Backend Developer\n
By now you should guess right, who a Backend developer is, is based on what Backend development is all about.

A Backend Developer is a skilled software developer responsible for or skilled enough to understand, plan, develop and test the server-side/business logic of an application. In conjunction with other team members, he is responsible for deciding the best and suitable tools and technologies for the project at hand.

Backend Development Tools and Technologies
Servers:
A computer that listens for incoming requests from the clients (frontend). Example of web servers are Apache Nginx, IIS servers, Tomcat.

A list of few things a Backend developer should learn under servers.

Types of Servers\n
Static
Dynamic
According to MDN:

A static web server or stack consists of a computer (hardware) with an HTTP server (software). We call it “static” because the server sends its hosted files as it is to your browser”. It response/server static content.

A dynamic web server consists of a static web server plus extra software, most commonly an application server and a database. We call it “dynamic” because the application server updates the hosted files before sending them to your browser visa the HTTP server.

In a simple term, Dynamic Server responses/serves dynamic contents.

Communication protocol (HTTP)\n
It comprises of the formal description of rules and formats of a digital messages.

Others
Load balancing
Message queues
Databases
Databases are frequently used on the Backend of an application. These provides data persistence. These databases provide an interface to save data in a persistent way to memory.

Types of database\n
MYSQL
SQlite
MongoDB
PostgreDB
etc

Things to learn in databases as a Backend developer\n
Schemas
Normalization
Indexes
Stored procedure and triggers
Wide knowledge of SQL, DDL & DML
Views
Strong database optimization skills

Software Stack\n
There are great list of server-side programming languages and frameworks to choose from in building the business/server logic of any application.

Check out the top 5 Backend framework.

The list below shows a recommended list of common topics a Backend developer should master in any programming language of choice.

Session management\n
Authentication & Authorization
Caching Mechanisms
APIs & Web Services
Software architectures (MVC)
Software design patterns
Algorithms and data structures
Structured logging
Debugging, profiling and tracing
Deployment

I will be releasing each of these topics in series in our official Youtube channel every Saturday, click to subscribe so you don’t miss it.

Things to consider as a Backend Developer\n
Scalability
Security
Robustness
Readability
Performance Oriented
Maintainability
Roles of a Backend Developer\n
Understands the goals of the software and comes up with effective solutions.
Compile and analyze data, processes and codes to troubleshoot problems and identify areas of improvement.
Collaborating with the frontend developers and other teams to establish objectives and design models (architecture).
Manipulating data and ensure authorized access to it at all times.
Developing, managing and working with external API resources across all devices securely.
Organizing the logic of the system using and implementing proper algorithms.

const cybersecurity = '''
  What is Cyber Security?\n
Cyber Security is a process that’s designed to protect networks and devices from external threats. Businesses typically employ Cyber Security professionals to protect their confidential information, maintain employee productivity, and enhance customer confidence in products and services.

The world of Cyber Security revolves around the industry standard of confidentiality, integrity, and availability, or CIA. Privacy means data can be accessed only by authorized parties; integrity means information can be added, altered, or removed only by authorized users; and availability means systems, functions, and data must be available on-demand according to agreed-upon parameters.

The main element of Cyber Security is the use of authentication mechanisms. For example, a user name identifies an account that a user wants to access, while a password is a mechanism that proves the user is who he claims to be.

Types of Cyber Crimes\n
Cybercrime is any unauthorized activity involving a computer, device, or network. The three types are computer-assisted crimes, crimes where the computer itself is a target, and crimes where the computer is incidental to the crime rather than directly related to it.
Cybercriminals usually try to profit off of their crimes using a variety of tactics, including:

Denial of Service, or DOS
Where a hacker consumes all of a server’s resources, so there’s nothing for legitimate users to access
Malware 
Where victims are hit with a worm or virus that renders their devices useless
Man in the Middle 
Where a hacker puts himself between a victim’s machine and a router to sniff data packets
Phishing 
Where a hacker sends a seemingly legitimate-looking email asking users to disclose personal information
Other types of cyberattacks include cross-site scripting attacks, password attacks, eavesdropping attacks (which can also be physical), SQL-injection attacks, and birthday attacks based on algorithm functions.

What Motivates Cyber Criminals?\n
The main motive behind the cybercrime is to disrupt regular business activity and critical infrastructure. Cybercriminals also commonly manipulate stolen data to benefit financially, cause financial loss, damage a reputation, achieve military objectives, and propagate religious or political beliefs. Some don’t even need a motive and might hack for fun or simply to showcase their skills.

So who are these cybercriminals? Here’s a breakdown of the most common types:

Black-Hat Hackers 
Black-hat hackers use fake identities to conduct malicious activities for a profit
Gray-Hat Hackers 
They work both with malicious intent and as legitimate security analysts
White-Hat Hackers
White-hat hackers work as security analysts to detect and fix flaws and protect against malicious hackers
Suicide Hackers 
They aim to openly bring down the critical infrastructure for a social cause
Script Kiddies 
They are unskilled hackers who run scripts and software created by more experienced hackers
Cyber Terrorists
They create fear by disrupting large-scale computer networks; motivated by religious or political beliefs
State-Sponsored Hackers 
They penetrate government networks, gain top-secret information, and damage information systems; paid by a hostile government
Hacktivists 
Promote political agendas by secretly defacing and disabling websites 

Who Are Cyber Security Experts?\n
As data breaches, hacking, and cybercrime reach new heights, companies are increasingly relying on Cyber Security specialists to identify potential threats and protect valuable data. It makes sense, then, that the Cyber Security market is expected to grow from \$152 billion in 2018 to \$248 billion by 2023.

So what do Cyber Security experts actually do? On any given day, they:

Find, test, and repair weaknesses within a company’s infrastructure
Monitor systems for malicious content
Identify network breaches
Install regular software updates, firewalls, and antivirus protection
Strengthen areas where attacks may have occurred
They work in one or more of these common Cyber Security domains to keep data safe:

Asset security: Analyze networks, computers, routers, and wireless access points
Security architecture and engineering: Standardize security policies and procedures
Communication and network security: Regulate cloud storage and data transfer
Identity and access management: Track user authentication and accountability
Security operations: Monitor security to identify attacks
Security assessment and testing: Test security policies to ensure compliance with industry standards
Software development security: Create and repeatedly test code
Security and risk management: Identify potential risks and implement appropriate security controls
Cyber Security experts employ different tactics to secure computer systems and networks. Some of the best practices include:

Using two-way authentication
Securing passwords
Installing regular updates
Running antivirus software
Using firewalls to disable unwanted services
Avoiding phishing scams
Employing cryptography, or encryption
Securing domain name servers, or DNS

const database = '''
  Every day, we create an estimated 2.5 quintillion (that’s a 1 with 18 zeros, just FYI) bytes of data, and this amount is accelerating at an exponential rate. More data has been collected in the past two years than in the entire human history. So where does all this data go? One of the foundational locations is a database. Without the database and ability to query the database, it would be nearly impossible to analyze any of that data in a meaningful way. It’s a truly exciting time in the data world with new approaches to data collection, manipulation and types of databases. With this, we need gatekeepers and maintainers for all these treasure chests of information. A group most commonly called database administrators.    
 

What is a database administrator?
 

Database Administration consists of everything required to manage a database and make it available as needed. The database administrator (DBA) is the person who manages, backs up and ensures the availability of the data produced and consumed by today’s organizations via their IT systems. The DBA is a critically important role in many of today’s IT departments, and by extension, their organizations overall.

For example, consider a commercial bank: the DBA is the person who ensures that the bank teller has easy, fast access to your information, and can quickly access your bank balance and transaction history. In this example, the DBA is a system or application-database administrator—a general DBA role responsible for most aspects of the organization’s databases. However, this is not the only kind of DBA.

A database administrator's responsibilities may include:
Installing and upgrading the database server and/or application tools.
Planning for and allocating the database system’s physical requirements, such as memory, disk space, network requirements, etc.
Modifying the database structure using information provided by application developers.
Creating users profiles, and ensuring system security by careful allocation of user permissions.
Ensuring compliance with database vendor license agreement, including number of installations, and taking care of licensing renewals.
Creating a backup and recovery strategy for the database, and regularly testing the backups to ensure usability.
Monitoring technical support for both database systems and related applications.
Creating reports by querying from database (as per need). These reports can be in the form of pre-formatted reports using the application frontend, or custom-made ad hoc reports by the database administrator.
Monitoring and optimizing the database’s performance using either manual or automated tools. This may be a DBA’s most important tasks.
Migrating database instances to new hardware and new versions of software from on premise to cloud based databases and vice versa.
Database administrator specializations
Just as the term ‘doctor’ can refer to a wide range of specializations, there is also a wide range of sub-specializations for the database administrator role. The DBA we described previously is the most common—one who works in-house or on contract for an organization to keep their internal databases chugging along optimally.

There are also database administrators who create and design databases in the first place. They usually work as part of a team, often in a more specialized software development company. And that database is likely to be part of a larger application for some specific business need. In the commercial bank example we used earlier, the bank most likely purchases or leases the software to run its banking operations from an Information Communication and Technology (ICT) company that specializes in banking software. This banking software is underpinned by a database, which is the backend storage for all the data, and that was designed and built by a team of specialist DBAs (more properly called ‘database designers’). They likely work with business analysts and others who are intimately familiar with banking operations to design the various application’s functions and modules. This is to ensure that all bank functions (loans, cash transactions, automated payments, ATM management, etc.) are created and reflected in the database structure.

Yet, another type of database administrator is the Performance Database Administrator or Tuning Database Administrator. This administrator specializes in optimizing and improving the performance of various databases. Databases are complex pieces of software. Simply put, a database’s internal structure consists of data stored within tables. Data access can then be optimized by use of indexes, which read like a book’s table of contents. DBAs help to ensure that the database is optimized to take advantage of the physical or virtual hardware on which it is hosted. This means it’s necessary to be able to split data across different disks, set up the database to better use the memory or RAM and optimize the network traffic of remote databases. Some databases are even split among multiple servers in so-called ‘distributed setups.’ Some databases can get so complex that they need a DBA who focuses solely on performance improvement. However, for smaller, single-company databases a non-specialist DBA is usually sufficient.

A third type of database administrator is the Application DBA. This role focuses specifically on integrating databases into the applications that use them. Navigating most databases usually requires knowledge of a specific type of query language. The most common is the Structured Query Language, or SQL. Most users will not learn how to use and navigate SQL; instead they will use a front end application to carry out the tasks required of them. In a commercial bank, this application is the banking software itself (the users are only able to access the database via an application, which ensures data security). It is the work of the application DBA to ensure that the database and the application using it communicate properly, and that accurate results are communicated between the two. For instance, when a user enters a customer name and clicks to display their bank account balance, the database returns the correct amount and not, say, the loan balance.

const graphics = '''
  what is graphic design?\n
According to the American Institute of Graphic Arts (AIGA), graphic design is defined as “the art and practice of planning and projecting ideas and experiences with visual and textual content.” In other terms, graphic design communicates certain ideas or messages in a visual way. These visuals can be as simple as a business logo, or as complex as page layouts on a website.

“Graphic design takes graphical and textual elements and implements them into multiple types of media,” says designer Alexandros Clufetos, when asked to elaborate on the graphic design definition. “It helps the producer connect with the consumer. It conveys the message of the project, event, campaign or product.”

Graphic design can be used by companies to promote and sell products through advertising, by websites to convey complicated information in a digestible way through infographics, or by businesses to develop an identity through branding, among other things.

“Every day, we take many of the subtly artistic things around us for granted. But hidden in every magazine corner, exit sign or textbook lies a set of design ideas that influence our perceptions,” says Jacob Smith, founder of illustration studio ProductViz.

It’s also important to remember that although many graphic design projects have commercial purposes like advertisements and logos, it is also used in other contexts and graphic design work is often created purely as a means for artistic expression.

Graphic design basics
To better understand the meaning of graphic design, it is important to be aware of the elements and principles that make up design. Elements are used in conjunction or opposition with each other to create visually striking and impactful designs.

These graphic design elements include:

Color
Form
Line
Shape
Size
Space
Texture
Graphic designers also adhere to the principles of design, which are essentially a set of guidelines that help a design achieve effective composition. These basic principles aid in creating balance and stability for the piece of work.

These graphic design principles include:

Balance
Contrast
Emphasis
Movement
Proportion
Rhythm
You’ve heard the old saying that “rules are meant to be broken,” which can certainly ring true in this case. But a good graphic designer must first understand these principles before making the conscious decision to break them.

Types of graphic design\n
As mentioned earlier, there is no single graphic design meaning. Graphic design is composed of many fields and specializations, ranging from print and web design to animation and motion graphics. Graphic design offers opportunities and options for individuals of almost any interest.

If you’d asked someone 30 years ago to define graphic design, their answer would have likely been focused on print-related examples like magazines, movie posters and advertisements. Now we’re living in the digital age, which has given birth to several new types of graphic design.

Some of the most notable modern-day graphic design examples stem from advancements in technology. Here’s a glimpse of some of these types of graphic design:

Website design involves creating engaging and intuitive web pages for users. This includes overall layout, color scheme and navigation.
User experience (UX) design is focused on ensuring a website or application is easy and satisfying to use. These designers emphasize value, usability, adoptability and desirability.
Motion graphics design—or animation—brings visual elements to life through special effects, TV shows, video games and movies.
Common graphic design jobs
With technological advancements introducing new types of graphic design, there has also been an emergence of new graphic design jobs. This evolution has changed the entire landscape of careers in this field.

Demand for “traditional” graphic designers who work primarily for print publishers has fallen substantially, but that doesn’t tell the whole story. Employment of graphic designers in computer systems design services is projected to grow by 24 percent through 2028, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS).1 Much of this demand is spurred by business’ and organizations’ increased need for digital graphics and imagery as they aim to increase their digital presence.

So with that said, what are some common graphic design job titles? We analyzed more than 30,000 job postings calling for a graphic design degree over the past year.2 The data helped us determine the most common job titles:

Graphic designer
User experience (UX) designer
Web designer
Art director
Creative director
As you can see, once armed with the proper knowledge and training, there are several graphic design job options out there. You have the ability to cater your career to your personal skills and interests.

Popular graphic design tools\n
Now that you know what type of jobs and specializations are out there, it’s helpful to familiarize yourself with the graphic design tools that help get the job done. One of the most basic, and least expensive, tools designers use is a sketchbook. Graphic designers will often sketch out ideas or rough drafts on paper before turning to a computer to complete the process.

That being said, computers and design software are essentials in today’s digital climate, even if you are designing for print. The type of computer you need is based on preference, but when it comes to software, Adobe products such as Photoshop, Illustrator and InDesign are mainstays in the graphic design world. If you are just beginning and don’t want to commit to the high price tag Adobe products often carry, similar free open-source software such as GIMP can help you begin to master the basics.

Lastly, ideas and inspiration are what a graphic designer needs most. “You need to have a solid concept serving as the foundation of your design and communication,” explains Chad Birenbaum, co-founder of Duckpin Design. “This concept and idea needs to work on paper first and then the computer should be used as a tool to bring the concept to life.”

Graphic designers gain inspiration from the world around them, so if you are worried you aren’t creative enough, go outside, bounce ideas off your peers or seek ideas from the internet. There plenty of inspiring graphic design blogs that can help get your creative juices flowing.

const uiux = '''
  We live in a beautiful era of design, with new techniques and trends coming and going. Frontend development is also gaining increased momentum, with more and more developers getting involved in UI/UX design.

While both UI and UX design are often placed on the same pedestal, they are fundamentally different, and beginners should understand the difference between the two.

UI Design — How Things Look\n
A UI (User Interface) deals with the application's graphical layout, which includes buttons, screen layout, animations, transitions, micro-interactions, and so on. In short, UI is all about how things look.

UI design includes the following formats:

Graphical User Interface (GUI): GUI design involves how users interact with the visuals and digital control panels of a system. The computer's desktop is an example of a GUI.
Voice-controlled Interface (VUI): VUI design deals with the interaction between a user and a system using voice. Smart assistants like Bixby for Samsung mobile devices and Siri for iPhones are examples of VUIs.
Gesture-based Interface: This is mostly used in virtual reality (VR) and other gesture-based design scenarios, which deal with the engagement of users within 3D spaces. Here is an example of our fully coded simulation of the Soft UI Admin Dashboard in VR:

For good UI design, you should take these characteristics into consideration:

The design should be focused on helping users complete tasks quickly with minimum effort. Completing tasks should be a seamless experience.
It should be enjoyable, satisfactory, and free from frustration.
The UI design should communicate the brand value of the company/organization.

UX Design — How Things Work\n
UX (User Experience) design deals with how users interact with the system. Logical navigation and how smooth and intuitive the experience is all fall under UX design. In short, this type of design helps users have a positive experience.

To get a feeling of the UX process, here are the main steps:

Interaction Design deals with how users can complete their tasks effortlessly by using the interactive components of a system (page transitions, animations, buttons, and so on).
User Research involves conducting extensive research, collecting feedback and ideas from new or existing customers, understanding end user needs, and making design decisions based on these parameters.
Information Architecture involves the organization of information and content that users need to do their tasks. This requires a UX designer to understand the relationship between different sets of content and present them in the most understandable way possible.
For good UX design, you should follow these practices:

The product should be easily usable, logical, and self-explanatory.
The product should solve users's problems.
The product should be accessible and usable to a wide range of people.
The product should create a positive experience for the user, allowing them to complete tasks without frustration.

  What is a product designer?\n
Fun fact: as product design derives from industrial design, product design has been around for quite a while longer than UX design. Despite this, the anatomy of a product designer remains elusive to many — sometimes including product designers themselves.

A product designer’s role is largely quite flexible, and can be likened to that of a full-stack designer; a multidisciplinary ‘jack of all trades’ designer who does UX, UI, coding, project management and (perhaps most importantly) problem-solving. In short, a product designer designs solutions to the problems that might arise during the initial process.

In order to solve these problems, product designers will assemble teams to facilitate solutions, create multiple test plans, produce wireframes and go through rounds of A/B testing. A product designer will also support the developers through the launch process, as well as working alongside the marketing teams to ensure synergy between the brand and the product.

They are, in short, the guardians of the product: ensuring it’s the most relevant, cost-effective and functional product it can be and that all the stakeholders are happy.

     Introduction to SEO\n
Search Engine Optimization, more commonly referred to as SEO, is one of the most crucial aspects of marketing. As such, if you’re working to market your blog or your business, you need to know what SEO means and what the rules and ways of SEO success are. While a successful SEO strategy isn’t an exact science, and its practice has been challenged on many fronts throughout the years, knowing the basics is still important to an effective marketing campaign. For more information about SEO and how to incorporate it into your marketing efforts, refer to the following SEO introduction for beginners:

What is SEO?\n
SEO refers to the process of making a website more visible on a search engine’s results page. To clarify, a great SEO strategy will put a company’s website at the top of the list on a Google search page, therefore increasing the likelihood that people will visit the site. Search engines strive to provide the most relevant results for a person conducting a search, so that when a person runs an internet search for “cupcakes,” the first thing to appear isn’t a cookie shop, but a bakery that specializes in cupcakes as well as a definition of the dessert. In other words, SEO helps to make a search relevant to the user and can be critical in driving traffic to your site.

Search engines work by searching the Internet to find text that meets certain criteria. This text is known as keywords and refers to the most important theme(s) of the website, company, or product. Scouring the online world to find keywords are why, as in the example above, a search for “cupcakes” yields a result of multiple pages about cupcakes, not cookies. Other important things that a search engine uses to rank a website include titles, headings, and links that make up the content of a website’s pages. Search engines also employ search engine indexing to find, digest, and store the content of a website. A search engine index refers to the set of data that’s used to base a final search result on.

The Importance of Keyword Research\n
Another important part of an SEO introduction is understanding the significance of keywords. We explained above that keywords are the specific words or set of words that best describe the theme or overall concept of an idea, website, business, or product. Keywords are the words that people use when conducting a search, and should be words that are included in the content of your webpage. Choosing the right keywords can help to drive traffic to your site, attract potential customers, and greatly improve your SEO ranking.

When deciding what keywords you should include in your text, you should consider things such as the relevancy of the keyword(s) to your website and company, as well as the competitors that are using the same keyword(s) (you can check this by running a quick Google search of chosen keywords yourself, and seeing what sites appear at the top of the list). To discover the value of your keywords, you can buy a sample campaign from Google AdWords, which will allow you to test the traffic generated by your chosen keywords. If all three things are in check—the keywords are relevant to your website, competitors are experiencing success with similar keywords, and a sample campaign yields high traffic—you should feel confident in moving forward with the keywords.

An SEO Introduction – More Important Factors\n
Keywords aren’t the only part of a successful SEO campaign, although they are certainly important. Other things to consider when developing an SEO strategy include links, titles, meta descriptions, headings, subheadings, originality of content, images and videos, and your audience. The most important thing to remember when reflecting on this SEO introduction is that one single factor will not determine SEO success; rather, SEO success is dependent upon your content as a whole.

When writing your content, spend an equal amount of time on trying to make your content sound as natural as possible, putting SEO at the back of your mind. Overusing keywords, creating weird or unnatural sentences with the hopes of improving SEO, or using unoriginal content can be more detrimental than beneficial to your SEO efforts. Content should always be interesting and engaging, be short and succinct, use keywords wisely, include optimized images with great titles, have headings that are appealing, be formatted in an easy-to-read way, and include relevant links. In fact, you may want to even consider participating in a link exchange, which refers to the process of exchanging links with other relevant websites in order to increase SEO.

Content greatly affects SEO. The more relevant your content, the more up-to-date the content is, and the more interesting your content is, the higher it will rank. Always plan your content in advance, have someone edit it before posting, utilize headings and subheadings, think about layout, and include pictures and or videos. Also, you should design your content and website so it’s easy to share via social media.

SEO Tools and Services\n
While an SEO introduction is a great starting point, as your marketing efforts progress, you may want to consider securing additional SEO tools and services. Often times, search engines themselves will provide these tools and services, such as Google’s Google Analytics, Google Webmaster Tools, Google AdWords Keywords Tool, Google Alerts, Google Trends, DoubleClick Ad Planner, Google Page Speed, Google Site Map, and more.

In addition to tools provided by Google, you can also explore other online tools, or even hire a company that specializes in SEO marketing to design your website and makes it SEO-friendly.

SEO is an important part of marketing in the online world and has many factors that can affect its success. In order to improve your website’s SEO, focus on creating great content, using relevant keywords, linking when appropriate, and always writing content that is creative and original. Additionally, remember that SEO is an on-going process, and doesn’t end as soon as you’ve posted content. Instead, keeping a website relevant and up-to-date by posting new, high-quality content frequently and consistently is equally important.

const aso = '''
    App Store Optimization (ASO) is the process of improving app visibility within the app stores and increasing app conversion rates. The major app stores are App Store for iOS and Google Play for Android. In addition to ranking high in the app store search results, ASO also focuses on click-through rate (CTR). This means you have to convince people to actually click into your app store listing once they find it. You can do so by optimizing your App Name, App Title, App Icon, App Screenshots and App Rating.

Why App Store Optimization is important for app growth\n
More than 5 million apps are available to download from the Apple App Store and the Google Play Store. It’s very likely that your app is facing a lot of tough competition.
The primary goal of App Store Optimization is to increase downloads and the number of loyal users. The first step of maximizing your downloads is to make your app easily discoverable by the right users. But how can you do that?

To understand how to boost your organic growth, you first have to understand how people are searching for and finding apps.

How do users find and download mobile apps?\n
People are mostly hunting for specific apps in app stores like Google Play Store and Apple App Store. A whopping 70% of mobile users utilize search to find new apps. Furthermore, 65% of all downloads occur directly after a search. Clearly, app store search is the most common method for discovering new apps.
Moreso, the search ranking position of an app directly correlates with the number of downloads. The higher your app ranks in the search results, the more relevant it appears to users. Higher ranking apps also get more downloads since users usually don’t scroll through every search result. They usually look at the first 5 or so. That’s why achieving a top rank is crucial to app success. Without App Store Optimization, you are missing out on the largest marketing channel for mobile apps and games.
Learning about ASO and investing time into it will be your secret weapon for app growth. It brings long-term results in a sustainable way. Curious about other advantages of ASO? Just continue reading and you will find out!

What are the benefits of App Store Optimization?\n
Now you know that most users find apps by searching in the app stores. Because of that App Store Optimization is a must if you want to get your app in front of the right users. In fact, many people argue that optimizing your app is the most effective marketing strategy for mobile apps and games.

Here is how you can benefit from App Store Optimization:

Improve Visibility & Stand out in the App Stores
People can’t download and use your app if they can’t find it. So no matter how great your app is, if it’s not easily discoverable you won’t reach the app success that you deserve. Don’t let all of your hard work go to waste, start optimizing!|
Always get discovered by high-quality and relevant Users
It is not enough that your app is found, it has to be found by the right users – users that are actually on a hunt for an app like yours. App Store Optimization gets you to the right users because it matches your app to relevant keywords. These are the search terms people will use to find your app. 
Increase Organic App Downloads in a Sustainable Way
A good ASO strategy will undoubtedly boost your organic installs and ensure long-term results. That’s because when people search for keywords related to your app, they’ll always find yours. With regular monitoring and updating you make sure your efforts are successful.
Cut User Acquisition Costs and Get Continuous Growth
Instead of spending money on ads, you can lower your user acquisition costs by focusing on organic growth with ASO. This not only saves you money, but also ensures steady growth. 
Increase App Revenue and Conversion Rates
There are various ways to monetize your app. This includes in-app ads, in-app purchases, and subscription models. As a result many of you may decide to run ads to bring in more users and thus, more revenue. But if your app store listing page isn’t converting, meaning convincing users to actually download your app, then your ad spend has gone to waste. Remember, App Store Optimization also involves Conversion Rate Optimization, getting people to click through and download. 
Reach a global audience with your app
By making your app available in other languages through an App Store Optimization process called localization, you can get users from all over the world to discover your app. ASO can help you take your app global.

const businessAnalyst = '''
  What does a Business Analyst do in Software Development?\n
A business analyst is a member of a product development team who analyzes the business domain, documents its processes and systems, outlines business requirements, and matches a software business model with the software being built.

If you think that a business analyst is kind of a jack-of-all-trades, well, that’s partially so.

On a bigger scale, a business analyst bridges the gap between stakeholders and the development team, interpreting business requirements into understandable development tasks to match a final software product with the expected business value.
At all development stages, a business analyst communicates with stakeholders, and product and marketing managers to capture business- and market-level requirements and then interacts with developers through a project manager, without a direct impact on the development process.

Business Analyst’s Role Description and Skills
To picture a typical business analyst, we’ve shortlisted the main things a BA must know and do.

Role Description\n
Usually, a BA has a set of main responsibilities that can be considered the backbone for the tasks they will fulfill in their role.

Clarifying a business idea. To understand which direction to choose, a business analyst should clarify the primary purposes of the future product. Also, a BA sets up the primary product benchmarks, such as customer acquisition strategy and value proposition, and helps decide on basic product KPIs. Then, they evaluate the most relevant means of implementation, which will be the most convenient for both stakeholders and developers.

Planning development activities. When primary business requirements are already established, it’s necessary to shape the development direction and allocate the areas of responsibilities. At this point, product development workshops with the participation of stakeholders serve as an efficient development tool.

Validating requirements. When approving the drafted documentation with business requirements included, the BA assures compliance of the development outcomes with a customer’s business goals. With both sides on the same page, everything goes in the right direction.

Standardizing the software development process. One of the main BA responsibilities is to assure that the single workflow with promised requirements is applied. When the product is being developed, a BA gets feedback from stakeholders and ensures product improvements according to the obtained data.

Documentation and visualization master. The business analyst role presumes making presentations to both stakeholders and developers. To do that properly, a good BA should provide consistent requirements documentation. Along with that, building wireframes is a crucial part of a BA’s activity. Although it’s not about strong UX design skills, schematic sketching and knowledge of tools  Unifying Modeling Language are compelling, necessary attributes.

const productManagement = '''
  What is Product Management?\n
The day-to-day tasks include a wide variety of strategic and tactical duties. Most product managers or product owners do not take on all these responsibilities. At least some of them are owned by other teams or departments in most companies. 

But most product professionals spend the majority of their time focused on the following:

Conducting Research: Researching to gain expertise about the company’s market, user personas, and competitors.
Developing Strategy: Shaping the industry knowledge they’ve learned into a high-level strategic plan for their product—including goals and objectives, a broad-strokes overview of the product itself, and maybe a rough timeline.
Communicating Plans: Developing a working strategic plan using a product roadmap and presenting it to key stakeholders across their organization: executives, investors, development teams, etc. Ongoing communication across their cross-functional teams throughout the development process and beyond.
Coordinating Development: Assuming they have received a green light to move forward with their product’s strategic plan, coordinate with the relevant teams—product marketing, development, etc.—to begin executing the plan.
Acting on Feedback and Data Analysis: Finally, after building, testing, and introducing the product to the marketplace, learning via data analysis and soliciting direct feedback from users, what works, what doesn’t, and what to add. Working with the relevant teams to incorporate this feedback into future product iterations.

Product management’s strategic function\n
Product management is a strategic function. Tasking product managers with determining a product’s overall reason for being—the product’s “Why?” 

They’re also responsible for communicating product objectives and plans for the rest of the company. They must ensure everyone is working toward a shared organizational goal. 

Product management encompasses a broad set of ongoing strategic responsibilities. They shouldn’t be responsible for the ground-level details of the development process.

Innovative organizations separate this function and assign tactical elements to project managers, such as scheduling and managing workloads. This distinct division leaves the product manager free to focus on the higher-level strategy.

Agile product managers
In an Agile organization, product owners also may be part of the puzzle. While there’s some debate, product owners are often considered part of product management. However, they are distinct from product managers. A product owner is embedded in one or more scrum teams, but their focus is mainly tactical, helping ensure the strategy laid out by product managers is appropriately executed. 

As one moves up through the ranks, more senior product management roles have more significant distinctions. For example, a product line manager will own multiple products that are typically related to each other, sometimes overseeing individual contributor product managers that manage a single product or sub-component.

const qualityAssurance =  '''
  Quality assurance (QA) is any systematic process of determining whether a product or service meets specified requirements.

QA establishes and maintains set requirements for developing or manufacturing reliable products. A quality assurance system is meant to increase customer confidence and a company's credibility, while also improving work processes and efficiency, and it enables a company to better compete with others.
The concept of QA as a formalized practice started in the manufacturing industry, and it has since spread to most industries, including software development.


Importance of quality assurance\n
Quality assurance helps a company create products and services that meet the needs, expectations and requirements of customers. It yields high-quality product offerings that build trust and loyalty with customers. The standards and procedures defined by a quality assurance program help prevent product defects before they arise.

Quality assurance methods
Quality assurance utilizes one of three methods:

Failure testing, which continually tests a product to determine if it breaks or fails. For physical products that need to withstand stress, this could involve testing the product under heat, pressure or vibration. For software products, failure testing might involve placing the software under high usage or load conditions.
Statistical process control (SPC), a methodology based on objective data and analysis and developed by Walter Shewhart at Western Electric Company and Bell Telephone Laboratories in the 1920's and 1930's. This methodology uses statistical methods to manage and control the production of products.
Total quality management (TQM), which applies quantitative methods as the basis for continuous improvement. TQM relies on facts, data and analysis to support product planning and performance reviews.

Quality assurance in software\n
Software quality assurance (SQA) systematically finds patterns and the actions needed to improve development cycles. Finding and fixing coding errors can carry unintended consequences; it is possible to fix one thing, yet break other features and functionality at the same time.

SQA has become important for developers as a means of avoiding errors before they occur, saving development time and expenses. Even with SQA processes in place, an update to software can break other features and cause defects -- commonly known as bugs.

There have been numerous SQA strategies. For example, Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI) is a performance improvement-focused SQA model. CMMI works by ranking maturity levels of areas within an organization, and it identifies optimizations that can be used for improvement. Rank levels range from being disorganized to being fully optimal.

Software development methodologies have developed over time that rely on SQA, such as Waterfall, Agile and Scrum. Each development process seeks to optimize work efficiency.

waterfall is the traditional linear approach to software development. It's a step-by-step process that typically involves gathering requirements, formalizing a design, implementing code, code testing and remediation and release. It is often seen as too slow, which is why alternative development methods were constructed.

Agile is a team-oriented software development methodology where each step in the work process is approached as a sprint. Agile software development is highly adaptive, but it is less predictive because the scope of the project can easily change.

Scrum is a combination of both processes where developers are split into teams to handle specific tasks, and each task is separated into multiple sprints.

To implement a QA system, first set goals for the standard. Consider the advantages and tradeoffs of each approach, such as maximizing efficacy, reducing cost or minimizing errors. Management must be willing to implement process changes and to work together to support the QA system and establish standards for quality.

QA team
A portion of careers in SQA include job options like SQA engineers, SQA Analyst and SQA test automation. SQA engineers monitor and test software through development. An SQA Analyst will monitor the implication and practices of SQA over software development cycles. SQA test automation requires the individual to create programs to automate the SQA process.

These programs compare predicted outcomes with actual outcomes. This work is used for constant testing.
